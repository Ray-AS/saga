You enter the small, cluttered hut of Elara, the village healer. The air is thick with the scent of dried herbs and the sound of gentle humming. Elara, a wise and aged woman with hands worn from years of tending to the villagers, looks up from her work. She listens intently as you explain your mission to investigate the troubles plaguing Brindlemark. Elara's expression turns grave, and she begins to speak of the strange maladies afflicting the livestock. 'The animals fall ill with no visible cause, their bodies weakened as if drained of life force,' she says, her voice barely above a whisper. 'I've tried every remedy, every potion, but nothing seems to work.' She hands you a small pouch containing a few withered leaves and a vial of murky liquid. 'These are from the last animal to fall ill. Perhaps they hold some clue.' As you prepare to leave, Elara's eyes lock onto yours, filled with a deep concern. 'Be careful, traveler. There's something amiss in our village, something that doesn't feel natural.'

---STORY---
As you examine the withered leaves, you notice they have an unnatural, brittle texture, and their color is more grey than the usual autumnal hues. The leaves seem to have been drained of their natural oils, leaving them fragile and crumbling to the touch. The murky liquid, on the other hand, has a pungent, acidic smell, like something has been rotting in the village's water source. You see tiny, almost imperceptible flecks of a dark, glittering substance suspended within the liquid. The combination of these observations suggests a malefic force at work, possibly related to dark magic or a corrupted natural resource. Thorne, the village elder, looks on with growing concern, his eyes darting between the withered leaves and the murky liquid. Elara, the village healer, seems hesitant to speculate, but her eyes betray a deep worry. The air is heavy with the weight of the village's troubles, and the fate of Brindlemark hangs in the balance. You must decide how to proceed, taking into account the potential consequences of your actions.

You make your way to the village's water source, a small spring that feeds into a nearby stream. As you approach, you notice the air is thick with an unnatural silence. The trees surrounding the spring seem to be dying, their leaves wilted and crumbling. The water itself appears stagnant, with a film of scum coating the surface. You can smell the stench of decay and corruption emanating from the spring. The villagers' livestock, which once drank from this spring, now lie ill and dying. You find a small, almost imperceptible symbol etched into the stone surrounding the spring. It seems to pulse with a faint, malevolent energy. The symbol is unfamiliar to you, but it fills you with a sense of foreboding. You realize that this corrupted water source is likely the root of the village's troubles.

You grit your teeth and try again, this time using a nearby stick to scrape at the stone. The symbol begins to fade, but the pain in your fingers grows, and you hear a low, ominous whispering in your ear.

With a swift motion, you slit the goat's throat, and its lifeblood spills onto the earth. The Devourer's power surges, and the ground trembles. For a moment, the villagers hold their breath, awaiting the outcome. The Devourer's voice, like thunder, speaks: 'The sacrifice is... accepted. But do not think this will save you.
