# Saga

## Overview

This project is a full-stack interactive story generator that allows players to progress through dynamic narratives by making meaningful choices. The game maintains persistent state, enabling stories to evolve coherently over time rather than resetting each session.

Players interact with characters, explore branching storylines, and experience consequences based on their prior decisions.
